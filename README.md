# ComputerNetwork_FinalProject


## Data Visualization

Use `Ui.py` to visualize some of the network data. Currently contains the input and output throughput using **psutil** and the video's *size of audio frame* and *size of video frame* using **ffplay**.


In `player_ffplay.py`, implemented a simple media player which can show the rtmp steeming's video by directly using the command of ffplay.
